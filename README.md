<h1 align="center">Lizz compatible Voltalis relay application</h1>

Lizz compatible application to add the [Voltalis Relay](https://github.com/airKlizz/voltalis-relay) application to a lizz managed Kubernetes cluster.

To learn more about Lizz, see the [documentation](https://openlizz.com).

## Requirements

To add the application, you first need to have a [Kubernetes cluster initialized with Lizz](https://openlizz.com/docs/guides/init).
You also need to have the [Lizz CLI installed](https://openlizz.com/docs/installation).

## Add the application

To add the application to your cluster, run the following:

```bash
lizz add github \
    --owner=$GITHUB_USER  \
    --fleet=fleet \
    --origin-url=https://github.com/openlizz/application-voltalis-relay \
    --path=./ \
    --destination=voltalis-relay \
    --set-value voltalis_username=$VOLTALIS_USERNAME \
    --set-value voltalis_password=$VOLTALIS_PASSWORD \
    --personal
```

Check the [guide](https://openlizz.com/docs/guides/add) to understand how works the lizz add command.

> **Note**
> You can adapt the command depending on your use case. See the [command API](https://openlizz.com/docs/cli/lizz_add_github) for more information.

Reconcile the fleet repository to deploy the application using [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/):

```

```
